# hello-world
My first Hello World! in Github.
👋 Hello, I am @ibarroladeveloper, passionate about computers and their derivatives
👀 I am interested in the world of IT, more than anything else in Web Development.
🌱 I am currently learning a career in full stack web development in the institute EducaciónIT
💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects that help me to enter and launch my career as a developer.

I have a love / hate relationship for coffee. I love extreme sports and the gym. I spend many hours practicing new things and training 
to be more efficient in my work.
